      <h3>Material Things</h3>
      <p>People tend to develop emotional attachments to their "things" not realizing just how much those "things" tie them down. The more things we have = the more space we need to house them. If you walk through your kithchen I'm sure you'll find multiple sets of dishes, silverware and appliances. How much do you have? How much do you need? What about paper? Most people have boxes of paper, old mail and useless documents stocking up for no apparent reason. You'll "get to it". How long have you been saying that? Maybe think about keeping the most important documents and electronically scanning the rest(of course while pitching the junk mail). If you go through your closet I'm sure it's full of clothes and shoes rarely or never worn. Take that as a sign. Books!!! We love them! But do you REALLY need all that you have. Even the ones you have already read? Even the ones you haven't read and probably won't in the near future? How about going through it all...closet and bookshelves and only keeping your faves and irreplacebles? The whole process can be freeing and therapeutic. Afterwards, donate the rest, give them away to friends or maybe even have a garage sale. Think about it. The money raised could be used instead for plane tickets and exploring the world.</p>

      <h3>Debt</h3>
      <p>Greed and over-consumption is abundant in this world. The 2008 Financial Collapse was largely caused by people acquiring things they truly could not afford and taking upon debt they did not fully understand. Of course, not all debt is bad. And yes, it's good to have a high credit score as bad credit can lead to higher costs and interest rates. But show some restraint. Be selective in your credit use. If you can't pay cash for a non-essential item then wait until you've saved the money or just go without. If borrowing money doesn't make you money then it's probably a mistake. You don't NEED that fancy car with the 6 year lease with a $600 car payment and 18% interest rate. You don't need that MERCEDES parked in front of your APARTMENT. You don't need that $500,000 home with an adjustable rate mortgage while having a $50,000 annual income. Spend wisely. Invest your money. Disallowing instant gratification can help keep things in proper perspective. I've known couples making over $200,000 a year who've had to file bankruptcy. Not because of unexpected medical issues or unemployment. Instead because they kept buying, leasing and going deeper and deeper into debt until they lost everything. Do better. Seriously, the more you owe the less freedom you have. Don't be a slave to your bills.</p></div>

      <h3>Social Media</h3>
      <p>Have you ever gone to a performance and immediately found yourself in a sea of cell phones in the air? The guests aren't really WATCHING the event but instead recording it as if to prove that they were there.  Have you been to a movie or restaurant and had the awful luck of sitting next to a person constantly texting or checking their phones? Maybe YOU are that person. It wouldn't be surprising. Millions of people are ADDICTED to social media. They can't go an hour without monitoring other's lives or sharing every moment of their own. Every move, every feeling, every meal...documented and shared with the world. Newsflash...social media is full of frauds. Those timeline tales are rarely authentic, mostly staged and are merely the equivalent of people's "highlight reels". Social media can trigger psychological damage as you obsess on presentation and life comparisons. Here's an idea...live for YOURSELF. Walk away from the constant status "updates" and focus on your OWN adventures. See the world WITHOUT your camera. WITHOUT your selfie stick. Without seeking the comments or "likes" of "followers". Disconnect and live a life of doing things for pleasure not just for posting. </p></div>
